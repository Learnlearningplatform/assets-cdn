1
00: 00: 00.000-> 00: 00: 05.757
It ’s still a long life to erase this feeling

Two
00: 00: 07.222-> 00: 00: 12.060
I want to redo what I left behind

Three
00: 00: 22.131-> 00: 00: 24.376
continuation of the dream

Four
00: 00: 24.454-> 00: 00: 28.343
I should have been chasing

Five
00: 00: 29.320-> 00: 00: 34.951
The winding narrow road stumbles on people

6
00: 00: 35.290-> 00: 00: 38.770
I don't want to go back like that

7
00: 00: 38.770-> 00: 00: 40.500
The lost sky

8
00: 00: 40.720-> 00: 00: 42.076
I am looking for

9
00: 00: 42.190-> 00: 00: 43.609
I hope you understand

Ten
00: 00: 43.669-> 00: 00: 45.460
Like sacrificed

11
00: 00: 45.508-> 00: 00: 48.653
Stop your sad face

12
00: 00: 49.070-> 00: 00: 50.541
The end of sin is not tears

13
00: 00: 50.660-> 00: 00: 52.162
I carry my back all the time

14
00: 00: 52.341-> 00: 00: 53.851
Exit maze invisible emotion

15
00: 00: 53.940-> 00: 00: 55.336
Who are you waiting for?

16
00: 00: 55.431-> 00: 00: 57.290
As spelled in a white notebook

17
00: 00: 57.510-> 00: 00: 59.044
I want to spit out more honestly

18
00: 00: 59.270-> 00: 01: 00.769
I want to escape from what

19
00: 01: 00.871-> 00: 01: 02.044
Reality?

20
00: 01: 02.610-> 00: 01: 05.390
I'm alive to make it happen

twenty one
00: 01: 05.569-> 00: 01: 08.792
In the middle of the night that seems to be forgotten

twenty two
00: 01: 09.012-> 00: 01: 13.117
I ca n’t do it safely

twenty three
00: 01: 14.410-> 00: 01: 16.155
I have no place to return

twenty four
00: 01: 16.220-> 00: 01: 19.830
To erase this feeling

twenty five
00: 01: 19.830-> 00: 01: 23.071
You still have a long life

26
00: 01: 23.310-> 00: 01: 26.179
This kind of pain that makes me miss you is welcome
